# Leaflet Mapping

This repository contains a project that visualizes global earthquake data using Leaflet.js. The map displays earthquake locations, depths, and magnitudes using data fetched from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) GeoJSON feed.

### Project Overview

This project utilizes Leaflet.js to create an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data from the past week, obtained from the USGS GeoJSON feed. The map markers are color-coded based on the depth of the earthquake and vary in size according to magnitude. It also includes popups with detailed information for each earthquake and a dynamic legend explaining the depth color scale.
